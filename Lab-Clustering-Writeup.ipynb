    "The first step was data cleaning. The original stats dataframe had way too many features that didn't contribute to the analysis. I trimmed it by about two thirds, keeping only relevant identifiers and meanigful stats correlated directly to performace. I then used idmax, a command I'd never used before, to drop duplicates for players who were traded while keeping their overall stats for the year. I then merged the stats df with the salary df, and dropped any missing values.\n",

I also set salary as a color spectrum and cluster as shapes on the plot, which allowed us to visualize trends. The dataset was pretty continuous so the visualization wasn't very helpful in understanding the clusters, but there was an overall correlation between the stats, clusters, and salary\n",

For example, if a player was in the candidates df and had a scaled salary of 0.35, they were in the C cluster (The best statistical players) and had a scaled relative value higher than 0.35 in every included performance metric (PTS, ASTS, RB, etc). I then sorted them by the mean of their scaled stats in descending order to put the highest performing players at the top. That sorting metric weighted every stat equally, which isn't ideal, but better than not sorting them at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally I selected 3 players for each of the 3 tiers required: bad, good, best. It is important to note that the players in the \"bad\" category are still great pickups, as they drastically outperform their salary, and perform at an extremely high level, even amongst NBA players. They are merely the worst of the best, but are still very solid options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad:\n",
    "Jabari Smith Jr, Onyeka Okongwu, Brandon Miller\n",

    "1)  Deni Avdija\n",
    "Number 1 in mean scaled statlines, relative salary of 0.24, best balance between value per dollar and overall value\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Keyonte George\n",
    "Top 3 in mean scaled statlines, with a staggeringly low relative salary of 0.06. By far best bang for buck but maybe not the best pick for pure wins, as any of these players would be pretty cheap\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Nickeil Alexander Walker\n",
    "Top 2 in mean scaled statlines, relative salary of 0.26, great all around player for value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision here would depend on how much money the team has to spend and the position they are already in. Keyonte George is pretty much as good as Deni Avdija but is much, much cheaper. If they are already a decent enough team, looking for the best valkue for their money, Keyonte George is the best pick, but if they feel gap in skill between Avdija and George would make a meaningful differece, and they have the money to get him, Avdija is the best pick.\n",
